# Covid19Tracker for India.
This is a simple one page application that show the total count of covid 19 patients which are confirmed,
active, deceased and recovered. 
This app shows the total count of all over India at top, and then list of all states with their respective count.
Dataset used is from the site of https://api.covid19india.org/data.json.
I have used GSON library for parsing this JSON dataset and have used Okhttp for building http connection with the site.
